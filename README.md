`LaserDetectionUnity` is an iOS protoype developed in Unity that retreives and maps detected red laser pointer coordinates as bullet holes via the native iOS plugin
[OpenCViOSPlugin](https://github.com/stevesopoci/opencv-ios-plugin).

1. Open `LaserDetectionUnity` in Unity.
2. The required iOS native plugin has been included in the project which can be found in _**Assets > Plugins > iOS**_. 
3. Test the project via mouse in the editor or switch to the iOS platform. 
4. After building to the iOS platform, follow the instructions found in the  README.md of [OpenCViOSPlugin](https://github.com/stevesopoci/opencv-ios-plugin).
4. If [OpenCViOSPlugin](https://github.com/stevesopoci/opencv-ios-plugin) is updated, remove the old plugin from `LaserDetectionUnity` and follow the instructions found in the native plugin's README.md.
